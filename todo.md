- [x] Implement pre-trip cost estimation based on distance and time

### Phase 6: Develop navigation and route tracking features
- [x] Implement turn-by-turn navigation display
- [x] Develop route and speed logging to the database

### Phase 7: Create offline synchronization and tracking API
- [ ] Design and implement a lightweight tracking API
- [ ] Implement offline location update synchronization

### Phase 8: Implement Leaflet map UI integration
- [x] Integrate Leaflet.js into Frappe forms and pages
