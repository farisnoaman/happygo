## Architecture Overview

The Hayago Mapping module follows a modular architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and performance. The system is composed of several interconnected components that work together to provide comprehensive mapping and location services.

### System Components

**Frappe Backend Layer:** The core business logic is implemented within the Frappe framework, utilizing Python for server-side processing. This layer includes DocType definitions for data modeling, API endpoints for client communication, and integration services for external APIs.

**Custom Tracking API:** A separate Flask-based API service handles high-frequency location updates and offline synchronization. This lightweight service is optimized for performance and can handle thousands of concurrent location updates.

**External Service Integrations:** The module integrates with Nominatim for geocoding services and GraphHopper for routing and navigation. These integrations are designed with fallback mechanisms and error handling to ensure system reliability.

**Frontend Interface:** The user interface layer combines Frappe's built-in UI components with custom JavaScript controllers and Leaflet.js for mapping functionality. This provides a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

**Database Layer:** Data persistence is handled through Frappe's ORM system, utilizing MariaDB for relational data storage. The database schema is optimized for geospatial queries and high-frequency location updates.

### Data Flow Architecture

The system follows a clear data flow pattern that ensures efficient processing and minimal latency:

**Location Updates:** Driver devices send location updates to the custom tracking API, which processes and stores the data locally before attempting synchronization with the main Frappe system. This design ensures that location updates are never lost, even during network interruptions.

**Trip Management:** Trip creation and management flow through the Frappe backend, which coordinates with external routing services to calculate estimates and generate navigation instructions. Trip data is then made available to the frontend interface for real-time display.

**Real-time Communication:** The system uses a combination of HTTP APIs and WebSocket connections for real-time communication between components. This ensures that location updates and trip status changes are reflected immediately across all connected clients.

### Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to support horizontal scaling through several mechanisms:

**API Service Scaling:** The custom tracking API can be deployed across multiple instances with load balancing to handle increased location update volumes.

**Database Optimization:** Geospatial indexing and query optimization ensure that location-based queries remain performant even with large datasets.

**Caching Strategy:** Redis caching is utilized for frequently accessed data such as driver locations and route calculations, reducing database load and improving response times.

**Asynchronous Processing:** Background job processing handles non-critical tasks such as data cleanup and batch synchronization, preventing these operations from impacting real-time performance.
